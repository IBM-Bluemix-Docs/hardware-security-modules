Complete the following steps to perform management tasks for your virtual servers from the Device List in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}:  
1. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} by using your unique credentials.
2. From the **Devices** menu, select **Device List**.
3. Click **Actions** for the device you want to manage and select the wanted management task.

## Deleting the server instance

At any time, you can delete your hardware security module if you no longer need the instance and don't want to be charged.

To delete the HSM, go to the menu and select **Cancel**.

## Powering off an HSM

To power off the HSM, go to the menu and select Power On/Off. While the HSM is powered off, you are still billed.

If the HSM is powered off, it remains in the power off state and you must manually power it on.
